            >Hello, and welcome to my LinkedIn profile! I'm a Java developer who
            is passionate about creating innovative projects using the latest
            technology. <br />
            I have a strong understanding of MVC architecture, Git, SQL, and
            JavaScript, and specialize in developing web applications with the
            Spring Framework. I'm experienced in working with Agile
            methodologies and have worked with REST APIs, SOAP, Bootstrap, CSS,
            and HTML. I strongly believe in the importance of testing and
            utilize JUnit to ensure my code meets high standards. As a
            developer, I'm eager to learn from experienced professionals and
            contribute my skills to a team. I enjoy brainstorming sessions and
            discussing ideas over a cup of coffee. Thank you for taking the time
            to view my profile, and I look forward to discussing how I can
            contribute to your team.
